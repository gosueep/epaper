### WIP - epaper display

### TODO
- Better coloring
    - currently just enhancing saturation
    - contrast and dithering didn't seem to help, but maybe more tuning on dithering would help
- better handling of horizontal images
- some images from the album have an added photo on them - might be just pulling thumbails

### Hardware
- 7.3 epaper display from Waveshare
- Raspberry Pi 4
